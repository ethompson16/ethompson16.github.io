    <img src="/img/advtimecover.png" alt="Adventure Time Intro Cover" width="500" height="400">
    <p>Adventure Time is a fantasy and adventure animated television show created by Pendleton Ward. The series follows
        Finn the Human and Jake the Dog and their many friends during their adventures in the Land of Ooo. The art style of the show
        is simple yet beautiful. The adventures of the characters vary from episode to episode. One moment they are making
        bacon pancakes and the next they are rescuing a princess that was kidnapped by the Ice King. They even grapple
        with existensial crises, making the show somewhat of a dark comedy. Although the hit-show was originally intended for younger audiences, the Adventure Time fanbase
        has gained followers from all ages, so here is everything you need to know about Adventure Time.

    <h2 id="the-main-lore">The Main Lore</h2>
    <p id="the-main-lore-paragraph">The show takes places in the fictional 'Land of Ooo' in a post-apocalyptic future after a nuclear holocaust 
        called 'The Great Mushroom War'. The creator of the show, Pendleton Ward, said it takes place 'after the bombs have
        fallen and magic has come back into the world'. The Mushroom does play a big part in the shows lore even though the creators never intended for it to be so explicitly post-apocalyptic
        so the show does play with the unknown because of how heavy the back-story of Ooo really is. The overarching plot of the show concerns the primary antagonist, the Lich, who is the manifestation 
        of death and existed before anything existed, even before the universe existed. However, there are several other reoccurring antagonists. The show has several timelines such as the Farmworld Timeline,
        created when Finn wished the Lich never existed, and Fionna & Cake's timeline, where all characters are gender-swapped. In short, the Adventure Time lore is massive. <a href="https://adventuretime.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline">Source</a>

    <img src="/img/finn.jpg" alt="Finn the Human" width="150" height="200">
    <p>Finn the Human is a quirky boy who is the main protagonist of the show. The show is, to some degree, his coming-of-age narrative.
        He is always wearing his statement white hat that covers his long and luscious blonde hair. He was abandoned by his parents 
    but was adopted by anthropomorphic dogs named Joshua and Margaret. These are the parents of Finn's best friend Jake the Dog. He is a hero through
and through, however, he still takes a liking to normal life. Finn has a long-standing crush on Princess Bubblegum and at one point he dates
Flame Princess. He is always up for a challenge constantly putting himself in risky situations. Some situations are even riskier because of his gulliable personality.

    proves useful over and over during their journies. He has a much more laid back personality than Finn and his magical abilities save him from dangerous situations. He is always
    cracking jokes but he also gives fantastic advice to lift up those around him when they need it. He loves to eat, and he eats much more than a dog should. He is in a relationship with
    Lady Rainicorn which whom he shares five children. <a href="https://adventuretime.fandom.com/wiki/Jake#Personality_and_character_traits">Source</a>

<p>Princess Bonnibel "Bonnie" Bubblegum (often called PB and occasionally Peebles, Bub-Bubs, or P-Bubs)[5] is one of the main characters of the series Adventure Time and first appeared in the animated short.
    Princess Bubblegum is the current incarnation of the Candy Elemental. Which is comparable to the inhabitants of the Candy Kingdom, who are all composed of types of desserts and candies. 
    She rules over the Candy Kingdom, but in the Season 6 episode "Hot Diggity Doom" (the first part of the season's finale), an election was held and she lost to the King of Ooo by a landslide. 
    As a result, she no longer ruled the Candy Kingdom and the King of Ooo replaced her as the new ruler until a rebellion against King of Ooo allowed her to reclaim the throne in "The Dark Cloud". 
    As of the Series Finale, Princess Bubblegum and Marceline have resumed their romantic relationship, and she is currently Marcelineâ€™s girlfriend again. <a href="https://adventuretime.fandom.com/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum">Source</a>

<p>Simon Petrikov, formerly known as the Ice King, is a major character in Adventure Time and a protagonist of its spin-off series Adventure Time: Fionna & Cake.

    revealing him to be a kind-hearted but misunderstood old man with completely twisted senses of morality and social behavior, suffering from loneliness and memory loss. 
    Later seasons unveil his tragic backstory, revealing he was once a good human named Simon Petrikov who lost his mind, memories and loved ones due to the magic crown giving him his ice powers. 
    In "Come Along With Me," Ice King is permanently reverted back to Simon after almost being digested by GOLB. <a href="https://adventuretime.fandom.com/wiki/Ice_King">Source</a>

     to Lumpy Space as well as to her parents' residence after she accidentally bit Jake in "Trouble in Lumpy Space".

    Princess Bubblegum, Lady's children, Jake, and Root Beer Guy are the only other beings in the Land of Ooo, besides Lady's parents, that are shown to understand Korean.

Disguised as a Rag Wizard, he used Finn and Jake to get a hold of Marceline's memory core containing her memory of breaking up with him so that he could destroy it, effectively making it like the break up never happened. As Marceline wakes up, he and Marceline go to his house where he asks Marceline to make him dinner. She then finds out what happened by viewing Finn's memory of her memory of breaking up with him. Marceline comes out of Ash's house with Finn and they jump on him and kick him, while Jake stretches into a giant sized foot and stomps on him at the end.

He is the high-strung, overly-zealous, obnoxious, paranoid, stubborn ruler of the Earldom of Lemongrab, and the heir to the Candy Kingdom. It is possible that he is no longer heir to the throne because as of "Hot Diggity Doom," the Candy Kingdom is now a democracy. He is the creation of Princess Bubblegum and the first of her experiments to go wrong. He was able to usurp the throne of the Candy Kingdom on the technicality of Bubblegum's de-aging.

<p>For a thousand years, humans were a critically endangered species in the Land of Ooo.

During the events of the aforementioned series, Finn was considered the few of his kind throughout Ooo.

    While there are many other magic users in Ooo, their status as a single, unified species has never been directly stated. As such, some wizards (e.g. Rock Wizard and Dimension Wizard) appear to be of completely different species, making it debatable if all characters called "wizards" or "witches" actually belong to a single species. However, since the Ice King and Betty Grof were once humans that became wizards later on in life, it's possible that wizards aren't necessarily born as such but can be transfigured from another species, similar to Vampires and Hug Wolves.

<p>Gum People (also called Gum Golems or Bubblegum Humanoids) are a recurring race of Candy People in the Adventure Time franchise. Candy is one of the four main elements that make up the Land of Ooo, the others being slime, fire, and ice. Gum people naturally take the appearance of humanoids composed of bubblegum, having pink hair and skin tones. The Mother Gum, a collection of living blob-like beings made of mutated bubblegum, spawned the only known currently living gum people, Princess Bubblegum, ruler of the Candy Kingdom, and her brother, Neddy, a Candy Dragon. Other gum people, such as Gumbald, Lolly, and Chicle, were created by Princess Bubblegum.
